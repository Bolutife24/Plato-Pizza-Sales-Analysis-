I performed analysis on the sales data of a fictional pizza restaurant for a period of one year. The data contains the date and time of each order along with the details of the pizzas served. The details comprise of the type of pizza, its size, quantity, price, and ingredients used. 
This dataset was obtained from (https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground)
## Project Steps
- Data Cleaning: I used the TRIM function in Excel to remove extra spaces from the data.
- Create tables and load the data into Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
- Exploration of the data
- Data Analysis with Power BI
- [To interact with my dashboard for this project] (https://www.mavenanalytics.io/project/5453)
