# Plato-Pizza-Sales-Analysis-
I performed analysis on the sales data of a fictional pizza restaurant for a period of one year. The data contains the date and time of each order along with the details of the pizzas served. The details comprise of the type of pizza, its size, quantity, price, and ingredients used.
## Project Steps

- Create tables and load the data into Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
- Exploration of the data
